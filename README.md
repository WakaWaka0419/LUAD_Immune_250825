### As a clinical medicine student who has been self-teaching bioinformatics for over three years, this journey has been both challenging and rewarding. I am thrilled to share that this work was officially accepted by Frontiers in Immunology on the first day of the 2026 Lunar New Year. To support reproducible research, I have provided all the code used in the study. While I have strived for clarity and rigor, I welcome any feedback or suggestions from the community to help further refine and improve the analysis. ###
